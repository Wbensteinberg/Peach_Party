# Peach Party

Peach Party is a two-player video game based off Mario Party. The players play on the same keyboard at the same time, dodging enemies, and rolling dice to travel around the game board. Players can land on event squares that can be good or bad, they can run into enemies and even teleport to random locations or land on jackpots. The player with the most coins at the end of the time limit wins.

I coded this using C++ Object-Oriented programming. I used over 10 classes with inheritance to code all of the characters and squares in the game.
